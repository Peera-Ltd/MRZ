# MRZParser

MRZParser is a simple, fast parser of MRZ codes commonly found in official documents, such as passports and visas.

This project supports MRZ of 3 types:

# TD1:
3 lines of 30 characters.

MRVA and MRVB are also supported but as there is no functionality to extract optional data, they are treated the same as TD2 and TD3 respectively.
